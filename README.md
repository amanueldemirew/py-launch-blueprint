1. **Install Just**:

```bash
# macOS
brew install just

# Linux
apt install just  # or use cargo install just

# Windows
choco install just  # or scoop install just
```

2. **Common Commands**:

```bash
# Show all available commands
just --list

# Development setup
just setup           # Install all dependencies

# Notes on tool choices

## Black

- Known as "The uncompromising code formatter"

Pros:

- Zero configuration needed - enforces a consistent style with minimal choices
- Very fast performance
- Used by many major projects like Django and pytest
- Maintains compatibility with modern Python features
- Excellent integration with popular editors and CI tools

Cons:

- Limited customization options by design
- Some developers find its formatting choices too opinionated
- Line length fixed at 88 characters (though this can be changed)

## isort

- Specifically for sorting imports. Often used in combination with other formatters

Pros:

- Best-in-class for import organization
- Highly configurable
- Works well with Black and other formatters

Cons:

- Single-purpose tool (imports only)
- Can sometimes conflict with other formatters

```python

# pyproject.toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py38']

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"  # Makes isort compatible with Black
multi_line_output = 3
```

Python line length standards:

- 79/80: Traditional PEP 8 standard. Good for side-by-side editing but can feel restrictive.
- 88: Black's default. Modern sweet spot between readability and expressiveness. Becoming the community standard.
- 100: Google's choice. Popular in enterprise. Good for complex expressions.
- 120: Maximum reasonable length. Works on wide screens but can hurt readability.
- Recommendation: Use 88 characters (Black's default) unless your team/project has an existing standard. It offers the best balance of readability and practicality while following modern community practices.

## Ruff

Ruff is a high-performance linter and code formatter for Python. It combines multiple tools into one, offering faster performance and comprehensive functionality compared to traditional Python tools.

Pros:

- Very Fast: Written in Rust, Ruff is significantly faster than traditional linters, allowing it to process large codebases quickly.
- All-in-One Solution: Ruff incorporates checks and fixes from a variety of popular linters like Flake8, Black, isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake. This means less maintenance of multiple separate tools.
- Customizable: Allows users to select and ignore specific checks or enforce particular rules according to the project needs.
- Easy Integration: Works well with CI/CD pipelines, IDEs, and modern developer workflows.
  Automated Fixes: Ruff can automatically correct a wide range of issues in your code.

Cons:

- Relatively New: As a newer tool, it might not yet be as widely adopted or supported in some edge cases.

## mypy

Most teams today actually run both mypy and pyright/Pylance:

- mypy in CI/pre-commit hooks for strict checking
- Pylance in VS Code for real-time development feedback

This combination provides comprehensive type checking coverage while maintaining a smooth development experience.

Let me explain the difference between `disallow_untyped_defs = false` vs `true`:

**disallow_untyped_defs = true**

```python
# This will raise an error
def process_data(data):  # Error: Function is missing type annotations
    return data + 1

# This is required instead
def process_data(data: int) -> int:
    return data + 1
```

**disallow_untyped_defs = false**

```python
# This is allowed
def process_data(data):
    return data + 1

# This is also allowed
def process_data(data: int) -> int:
    return data + 1
```

**When to use each:**

Use `true` when:

- Starting a new project
- Working on a codebase that's fully committed to type hints
- Want to ensure complete type coverage
- Have a team that's comfortable with Python type hints

Use `false` when:

- Gradually adding types to a legacy codebase
- Working with test files (common to disable for tests)
- Training team members who are new to type hints
- Need to temporarily bypass type checking for specific modules

**Best Practice Recommendation:**
Start new projects with `true` for maximum type safety. For existing projects, use `false` initially and gradually enable it as you add type hints to the codebase. Many teams set it to `false` for test files but `true` for production code.

VS Code Settings for pyright/Pylance

```json
{
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict",
  "python.analysis.diagnosticMode": "workspace",
  "python.analysis.autoImportCompletions": true,
  "python.analysis.importFormat": "relative",
  "python.analysis.inlayHints.functionReturnTypes": true,
  "python.analysis.inlayHints.variableTypes": true
}
```

Common Type Annotation Examples

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Union, TypeVar, Generic

# Basic type annotations
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}"

# Optional parameters
def fetch_user(user_id: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Union[str, int]]:
    ...

# Generic types
T = TypeVar('T')
class Stack(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.items: List[T] = []

    def push(self, item: T) -> None:
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self) -> T:
        return self.items.pop()

# Type aliases
UserId = int
UserDict = Dict[UserId, Dict[str, Union[str, int]]]

# Callable types
from typing import Callable
Handler = Callable[[str, int], bool]

def process(handler: Handler) -> None:
    ...
```

## Precommit hooks

Hooks are designed to maintain clean, consistent, and error-free code and configuration files. They save time by catching issues before they make it into your repository.

Following pre-commit hooks are used in this repo

- `check-yaml` checks if all YAML files in your repository are valid,
- `end-of-file-fixer` ensures every file in your repository ends with a single newline character,
- `trailing-whitespace` removes trailing spaces at the end of lines in your files,
- `check-toml` checks if all TOML files in your repository are valid,
- `check-added-large-files` warns when you try to add large files to the repository,
- `mypy` checks your Python code for type errors based on type annotations,
- `ruff` acts as a fast linter and formatter for Python, ensuring clean code,
- `black`formats Python code to enforce consistent and opinionated style rules across your codebase.

## Python Types Common Issues and Solutions

1. Third-party library types:

```bash
# Install type stubs for common libraries
pip install types-requests types-PyYAML types-python-dateutil
```

2. Ignoring specific lines:

```python
# mypy
reveal_type(x)  # type: ignore

# pyright
x = something()  # pyright: ignore
```

3. Type checking only specific files:

```bash
# mypy
mypy src/main.py src/utils.py

# pyright
pyright src/main.py src/utils.py
```

disallow_untyped_defs = true vs false

- Use `true` when starting new projects or working with teams experienced in type hints who want complete type coverage.
- Use `false` when adding types to legacy code, working with test files, or training developers new to type hints.

disallow_untyped_defs = true

```python
# This will raise an error
def process_data(data):  # Error: Function is missing type annotations
    return data + 1

# This is required instead
def process_data(data: int) -> int:
    return data + 1
```

disallow_untyped_defs = false

```python
# This is allowed
def process_data(data):
    return data + 1

# This is also allowed
def process_data(data: int) -> int:
    return data + 1
```
